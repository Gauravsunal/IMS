# IMS
Inventry Managment System

In this project i have made IMS.ipnyb file which contains all the records of inventry 

in that record there are 30 things 

and after that we have Add New Item into Inventory and then print it 

And then we have made purchasing_products.ipnyb which consist of all purchase and sales sort of things .

we have contain all record of inventry in record.json file 

And one more file for sale which called as sales.json 

this is pretty much all about my IMS .
